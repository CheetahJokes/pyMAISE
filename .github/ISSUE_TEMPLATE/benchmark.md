## Data

{Please discuss the data you would like to incorperate in pyMAISE. If this data has already been published then please link the paper.}

## Tasks

- [ ] Add the data to `pyMAISE/datasets/`. Please respect the GitHub large file limit. The hosting of data locally is temporary until we find a permanent location.
- [ ] Add a load function to `pyMAISE/datasets/_handler.py` and include a discription of the data in the docstring. The load function should return Xarray data structures.
- [ ] Create a Jupyter notebook for the benchmark in `docs/source/examples/`.
- [ ] Add the relative path to the notebook to `docs/source/benchmarks.rst`.
- [ ] If a reference for the data set exists, then add the bibtex citation to `docs/source/data_refs.bib`

## Definition of Done

All tasks above are completed, a pull request is opened, reviewers are satisfied, and the code is merged into develop.
