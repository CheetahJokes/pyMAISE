Benchmark Jupyter Notebooks
===========================

Welcome to the pyMAISE benchmarked Jupyter Notebooks! These notebooks include the machine learning benchmarks for reactor control, reactor physics, fuel performance, and heat conduction data sets. Follow the :doc:`benchmarks/mit_reactor` notebook for an introductory tutorial with pyMAISE. The other notebooks focus on the models and methods instead of applying pyMAISE.
