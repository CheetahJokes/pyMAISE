Example Jupyter Notebooks
==========================

Welcome to the pyMAISE example Jupyter Notebooks! These notebooks include the machine learning benchmarks for reactor control, reactor physics, fuel performance, and heat conduction data sets. Follow the :doc:`mit_reactor` notebook for an introductory tutorial with pyMAISE. The other notebooks focus on the models and methods used as opposed to the application of pyMAISE.
